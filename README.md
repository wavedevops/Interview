Excellent question, Hari! You're asking:
**"How can *I ask* questions in this 3-part (What, How, Why) style like an interviewer or while learning?"**

Here’s how you can **form and practice such questions** on your own or with others:

---

### ✅ 1. Start with “What is it?” → Ask about the definition

👉 *What is a Pod?*
👉 *What is Git Flow?*
👉 *What is Infrastructure as Code?*

---

### ✅ 2. Then ask “How does it work?” → Ask about process or working

👉 *How does a Pod work in Kubernetes?*
👉 *How does Git Flow manage code branches?*
👉 *How does Infrastructure as Code help in automation?*

---

### ✅ 3. Finish with “Why is it used?” → Ask about reason or benefit

👉 *Why do we use Pods instead of just containers?*
👉 *Why is Git Flow helpful in teams?*
👉 *Why should we use IaC tools like Terraform?*

---

### 🔁 Bonus: Practice This Template

Just pick any topic and apply this:

**"What is X?"**
**"How does X work?"**
**"Why do we use X?"**

👉 Example: Load Balancer

* What is a Load Balancer?
* How does a Load Balancer work?
* Why do we use Load Balancers in production?

Do you want to try asking one by yourself? I’ll help you shape it!

Thanks for being clear, Hari. Here's **your simple, meaningful way to learn and ask any technical concept in general English** — **easy to remember and speak**:

## 🌟 The "Easy 3W Method" to Learn Anything

### ✅ 1. **What is it?** → *(What's the meaning?)*

Ask: **“What is it in simple words?”**
👉 Example: *What is a Pod?*
🗣️ *It’s like a box that holds one or more containers together.*

---

### ✅ 2. **Why do we use it?** → *(What's the use?)*

Ask: **“Why do people use it?”**
👉 Example: *Why do we use Pods?*
🗣️ *To run containers together that share network and storage.*

---

### ✅ 3. **How does it work?** → *(How does it help or do the job?)*

Ask: **“How does it work in real life?”**
👉 Example: *How does a Pod work?*
🗣️ *It gives one IP address to all containers inside and helps them work like a team.*

## 🧠 One Line to Remember:

> ✨ **What is it? → Why use it? → How does it work?**

Repeat this for every DevOps concept — **simple, meaningful, easy to speak**.
