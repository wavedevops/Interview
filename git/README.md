* Git Flow  
  We have a `main` branch and if the developer wants to work, they will create a `feature` or `develop` branch.  
  From there, they will work. At the end of the day, they can merge it with the `main` branch.  
  We have a `hotfix` branch. If anything needs to be deployed urgently, we will deploy through the `hotfix` branch.  
  At the end of the day, we will delete the `feature` or `develop` branch by raising a PR (Pull Request).  
  Once we merge it, we delete the branch.
