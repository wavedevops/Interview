  - Exposes a service on a specific port (NodePort) on each node's IP, allowing external traffic to access the service.

  * Why do we need Kubernetes when you already have Docker?

  Docker is an image-building, storing, and container-creation technology. However, Kubernetes is a container orchestration technology.

  Managing Docker containers across multiple hosts becomes challenging at scale. Kubernetes addresses this by providing:

  - Auto Scaling
  - Networking
  - High Availability
  - Reliability
  - Self-Healing
  - Storage
